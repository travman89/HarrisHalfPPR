# HHPPR
**Code currently running [hhppr.com](https://hhppr.com). **

A simple React app that combines the standard and 0.5 PPR ranks found on [harrisfootball.com](https://harrisfootball.com). This is a morning project that is slowly growing over time. Large portions of this codebase are not refactored and may have remnants of experimentation or old code.  I'll clean it up some day ðŸ˜‰.

### Run the app
```
yarn && yarn dev
```

### TODOS
- [x] Experimental ECR 
- [ ] Draft tool
- [ ] In season ECR
- [ ] Read data from external source and not from `/data`
- [ ] Dynamic updated date
- [ ] New Legend component
